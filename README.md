# Multithreading_Python

Python script utlizing multthreading capability. In the example I create 4 threads (number can be changed) which shall envoke run_remote_cmd worker function.

In the script I am using two Queues. One queue (work_queue) holds all commands that need to be run remotely on a linux machine. The second Queue is results_queue which shall hold the results generated by the work done by the threads.

Each thread instance goes and gets one command out of the work_queue and then runs it and puts the results in the resulsts_queue. 

Eventually I take the results out of the results_queue and convert it into a dictionary to then be printed out.
